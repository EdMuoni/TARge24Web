    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 to 340[a] flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. The natural range of Magnolia species is disjunct, with a main center in east, south and southeast Asia and a secondary center in eastern North America, Central America, the West Indies, and some species in South America.

        Magnolia is an ancient genus. Fossilized specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago (mya), and fossils of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 mya.[3] They are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles as they existed prior to the evolution of bees.[4] Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage, such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants, such as Lilium).

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        Ranunculus is a large genus of about 600 species of plants in the Ranunculaceae. Members of the genus include the buttercups, spearworts, and water crowfoots. 
        The petals are often highly lustrous, especially in yellow species, 
        owing to a unique coloration mechanism: 
        the petal's upper surface is very smooth 
        causing a mirror-like reflection. 
        The flash aids in attracting pollinating 
        insects and temperature regulation of the 
        flower's reproductive organs. The flash is 
        also visible to humans. The name Ranunculus is 
        Late Latin for "little frog," the diminutive of rana. 
        This probably refers to many species being found near water, like frogs.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        The tulip is a Eurasian 
        and North African 
        genus of herbaceous, 
        perennial, bulbous 
        plants in the lily family, 
        with showy flowers. 
        About 75 wild species 
        are currently accepted. 
        The genus's native range 
        extends west to the Iberian 
        Peninsula, 
        through North Africa to Greece, the Balkans, Turkey, throughout the Lev
